Average node degree for this graph is 2.386. This means that on average, each movie has roughly 2 similar titles. This average is not very meaningful because when the degree distribution is viewed, the node degree ranges from 0 to 16 with a degree of 1 accounting for more than 300 while there are less than 50 with a degree of 2.

This graph has a network diameter of 26. Intuitively, this means that the longest shortest path between any two nodes is 26. A node that is connected to another node with one edge in between has a distance of 1. For every node, the maximum distance to another node via the shortest path is 26.

Average path length is the average distance between two nodes for all nodes in the graph. This means that on average, there are 8.697 edges connecting two nodes.
